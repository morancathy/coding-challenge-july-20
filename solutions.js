// Verbal Questions
// 1) The difference between a parameter and an argument: A parameter is the variable a function accepts (listed inside the
// function definition), an argument is the variable that is passed into the function when the function is called.

 // 2)  The difference b/w return and console.log: A function returns a value with the 'return' statement. It gets returned to the
 // exact location the function was called.  A console.log is any data that is wrapped in () after the console.log statement that
 // will print to your computer console. The console.log is used during development as a 'checking' measure. The return is actual
 // data that will be used in your code.
